I put out a poll on Friday to see what I should create and a Twitch stream package won! In a comment, [Dave Craige](https://twitter.com/davecraige) asked if I'd tried out [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) yet - which I had, but hadn't given it much love since I tend to hop into code... It's faster for me to write CSS than fight software to draw a button. Since my new project would involve designing graphics, I started from scratch in Figma to design what would become **Shatter**.

## Meet Shatter

Shatter is an origami-esque polygon design for OBS/Xsplit built with Figma which includes:
- Static background images
- A webcam frame overlay
- Panel templates and a Banner image for your Twitch profile
- Offline background for your broadcast profile (such as Twitch)

![Shatter preview](https://blog.melaniemagdalena.com/images/shatter-content.jpg "Shatter preview")

> **Why Figma?** Figma is web-based making it ideal for anyone who doesn't have OS-dictated software. It also has a free tier so you don't need to dump money into something for *just one thing*. (But if you love it, please consider supporting them by upgrading to a paid account :D)

## Get Shatter

Start customizing Shatter! First you'll need to get the files.

1. [Log in to Figma](https://www.figma.com/). You can create a free account or sign in with Google.
2. Open up [Shatter](https://www.figma.com/file/XYJX8SQuTukUesDWlNGgqrKa/Shatter-Stream-Package?node-id=7%3A742).
3. You'll want to create a copy with the **Duplicate to your Drafts** option.

## Customize Shatter

Now that you have the files, it's time to make it your own. Head over to the **Settings Page**.

### Colors

You can change the colors used across the package via **Local Styles** in the right-hand sidebar. Select the color and click the toggle to open up the color picker. When you like the hue, simply click out of the color picker.

![Change the color](https://blog.melaniemagdalena.com/images/figma-color-swap.gif "Change the color")

### Handle

Change your handle (mine is @m2creates) on the **Headline** frame in the **Username** symbol. This will update your handle across all the backgrounds.
> Readjust the **Shatter** symbol on its left if your handle overlaps. You can also reposition the **Social Group** symbol.

### Social Icons

The **Headline** frame has a symbol called **Social Group**. You can swap out or add additional icons with the **Detach Instance** option.

> Detaching the instance will let you nest new icons inside the symbol so it updates everywhere at once.

### Change the Text

You can change the text:
- from the **Backgrounds** page for **Backgrounds** and **Offline Image**
- from the **Panels** page for **Panel** and **Banner** images

Click on the frame you would like to edit and navigate to the Text object of the symbol. You can interact with the text by double clicking and typing out what you'd like on the graphics.

![Edit the text](https://blog.melaniemagdalena.com/images/figma-text-edit.gif "Edit the text")

## Export Shatter

In order to export your new images, you will need to download the edited **frames** as 2x PNGs.

You can select one or multiple frames on a Page via the left sidebar.

Once your desired frames are selected, choose **2x** and **PNG** from the **Export** module in the right sidebar. A dialog prompt will open for you to choose the download destination.

![Export your frames](https://blog.melaniemagdalena.com/images/figma-2x-export.png "Export frames at 2x for PNG")

> By exporting at 2X resolution, your images will scale down to a *crisp* output on both your broadcasting software and Twitch's upload UI.
