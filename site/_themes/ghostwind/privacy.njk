You Are Here:
- Privacy for Ghostwind
- site/_themes/ghostwind/privacy.njk

How It Works:
- On build, this page fills in your name, site URL, and email address
  from site/_data/site.json

Dynamic Data:
- anything in {{ curly braces }} is a variable from:
  (a) frontmatter in the associated markdown file (site/pages/privacy.md)
  (b) site/_data
- aliases are defined in `{% set %}`

TODO: Add LAST MODIFIED time instead of default date
